About Me
Dr. Annie Hui is a cultural studies scholar whose research examines the aesthetics of digital activism and visual protest in East and Southeast Asia, with a focus on transnational coalitional solidarity and the performative framing of resistance. Her research is rooted in critical theory, visual rhetoric, and technopolitics, drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks to examine how citizen-activists strategically re-appropriate visual economies and digital platforms to express dissent and challenge systemic injustices, particularly under conditions of democratic fragility, economic precarity, and state-sanctioned violence.

Hui earned a Ph.D. in Cultural Studies from George Mason University, where her dissertation, “Appropriating Resistance: Popular Culture as Visual Tactic in Sites of Protest,” theorized the semiotic and affective dimensions of protest iconography in pro-democracy movements across Thailand, Hong Kong, and the United States. Her research has appeared in Anthropological Notebooks, Hong Kong Studies Journal, and the edited volume Quiet Defiance: The Rhetoric of Silent Protest.

Her current book project, Sign Here: Tracing Protest Symbols and Democratic Futures, examines the commodification and erasure of popular protest symbols in global media ecologies. A second project, Have You Eaten Yet?: Civic Solidarity and Mutual Aid in East and Southeast Asia’s Platform Economies, develops the concept of logistical care to theorize how algorithmic labor and food-sharing practices are mobilized to contest neoliberal governance and cultivate civic intimacy.

As a first-generation immigrant from Hong Kong, Hui’s work is grounded in a commitment to inclusive pedagogy and coalition-building across borders. Hui’s teaching spans Cultural Studies, Global Affairs, Modern and Classical Languages, and English Studies. She has held faculty appointments at George Mason University and Hong Kong Baptist University, where she also served as Co-director of the English Support Service and editor of the college’s literary journal. Her academic service includes roles on conference planning committees, editorial review boards, and university governance, alongside community-based work supporting immigrant, elder, and migrant worker populations in Hong Kong and New York City.
